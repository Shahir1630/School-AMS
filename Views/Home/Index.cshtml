                    will admit boys and girls from all walks of life strictly on merit through admission tests.
                    It is expected that their academic training at this great institution would make them physically
                    and mentally sound enough to adjust and complete with the rest in the pursuit of higher studies.
                    They would eventually turn out as complete men and women having full confidence in their ability in the challenging world..
